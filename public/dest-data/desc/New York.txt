“The City that Never Sleeps” is a city that needs no introduction, of course. The Statue of Liberty has not moved, Central Park still stretches from 59th street to 110th Street (between Fifth and Eighth Avenues), and the Museum of Natural History still stands more or less across the park from the Guggenheim Museum and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in Upper West and Upper East sides respectively, and the Empire State Building is still there, towering over Fifth Avenue at 34th Street.
